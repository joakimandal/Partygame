The game contains multiple small minigames, with a game length that vary from 20 seconds up to 10-20 minutes.

# Requirements

* A computer, capable of running java 
* For each participant, an ios or an android smartphone or tablet
* A wifi router or a computer simulating a wifi router
  * Newer windows laptops may have this feature
  * There is no need for an internet connection. All you need is to connect the computer and phone through local wifi.

When launching the app, the app shows a connect button so that the player can connect to the game.

Clicking the connect button will show an input dialog where you write a name that will be shown on the game(running on the computer).

After writing a name and connecting, the first player will get a "leader controller", so that he can change settings and start a game.

The rest of the players will get a screen showing that they are connected, and waiting for the leader to start a game.
